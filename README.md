### About
Welcome to our web developer assessment! This test aims to evaluate your skills in WordPress front-end development, including theme creation, prototyping, and styling. You will be presented with a real-world scenario where you will create a one-page website for an AI-Driven Recruitment and Talent Matching startup.

### Scenario
Imagine you are a web developer working for a client, an AI-Driven Recruitment and Talent Matching startup. They have requested a one-page website to showcase their services and mission. Your task is to create this website using a WordPress installation with FlyntWP as the starting point.

### Company Information
To help you align with the scenario, here is the company name and logo assets for StellarHire:

- **Company Name:** StellarHire
- **Slogan:** Matching Dreams to Careers with AI

**Company Logo Assets:** [StellarHire Logo Assets](./StellarHire-01.svg)

Feel free to incorporate these assets into your website design to create a cohesive representation of StellarHire's brand.


### Requirements
Your responsibilities include wireframing, prototyping, theme development, and front-end styling. Optionally, you can also develop a WordPress plugin if time permits.

### First Steps
Here's a step-by-step guideline for each part of the test:

#### Wireframing and Prototyping:
- Use a wireframing and prototyping tool of your choice (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD).
- Create a one-page website prototype for the AI-Driven Recruitment and Talent Matching startup.
- Focus on user experience and align with the startup's branding.

#### WordPress Theme Development:
- Utilize the provided WordPress installation with FlyntWP [WordPress-Setup](./WordPress-Setup)
- Develop a new Component Block for Flip Cards and integrate it into the theme.
- Prioritize functionality over elaborate design details.

#### Front-end Development:
- Implement SCSS and styles to make the website match the prototype.
- Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.

### Scope
Please note the following:

- Detailed design intricacies are not a primary concern in this test. Focus on functionality and responsiveness.
- The plugin development task is optional and can be attempted if time permits. It's not mandatory.
- If you are not comfortable with FlyntWP, you are allowed to use a different theme starter of your preference. Ensure that it aligns with WordPress best practices and allows you to complete the tasks within the given time frame.
